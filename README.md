Central WENO project

Date: 2020/01/08
This project is a simple implementation of central WENO interpolation and reconstruction. The reference papers are ... such .. such (will update).
I can't guarantee the implementation to be 100% correct; but so far the results are OK. The final aim of this small project is to have an understanding
of the central WENO and put the implementation into GPU.
